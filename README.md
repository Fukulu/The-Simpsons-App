# Note:
I HAVE TAKEN ALL OF THE IMAGES IN THE APPLICATION FROM VARIOUS WEBSITES ON THE INTERNET AND WITHOUT ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE, I AM ONLY INCLUDING THEM IN THE APPLICATION BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A SWIFTUI TRAINING FOR MYSELF AND A GOOD CODING TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BENEFIT FROM IT. I STATE THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO COPY OR REPRODUCE AN EFFORT MADE BY ANY ILLUSTRATOR. FOR CONTACT;
